========0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary project task========

This project entails the following tasks

>>>>0-square_matrix_simple.py
	function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
	
>>>>1-search_replace.py
	function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
	
>>>>2-uniq_add.py
	function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
	
>>>>>>3-common_elements.py
	function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
	key argument: always be a string
	value: argument will be any type
	If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
	If a key does not exist in the dictionary, it will be created
	
>>>>>>4-only_diff_elements.py
	function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
	
>>>>5-number_keys.py
	unction that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
	
>>>>6-print_sorted_dictionary.py
	
	function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

	Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
	You can assume that all keys are strings
	Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
	Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
	Dictionary values can have any type
	
>>>>>7-update_dictionary.py
	"""function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
	key argument: always be a string
	value: argument will be any type
	If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
	If a key doesn’t exist in the dictionary, it will be created"""
	
>>>>>8-simple_delete.py
	function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
	key argument will be always a string
	If a key doesn’t exist, the dictionary won’t change
>>>>>9-multiply_by_2.py
	function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
	Returns a new dictionary
>>>>>10-best_score.py
	function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
    	values are only integers
   	 return: none if no score are found
    	assume all student have different score
    	
>>>>> 11-multiply_list_map.py
	function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
	Returns a new list:Same length as my_list
			:Each value should be multiplied by number

>>>>12-roman_to_int.py
	function: def roman_to_int(roman_string) converts Roman numeral to int
    	assume the number will be between 1 to 3999.
    	return: 0 if none or roman_string is not a string
    	
>>>>>>100-weight_average.py
	function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple
    (<score>, <weight>)
    Return: 0 if the list is empty"
    
>>>>> 101-square_matrix_map.py
  	function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
Prototype: def square_matrix_map(matrix=[]):
	matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns: a new matrix:
	:Same size as matrix
	 :Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	Initial matrix should not be modified
	
>>>>>102-complex_delete.py
	function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
    	If the value does not exist, the dictionary will not change
    	All keys having the searched value have to be deleted
